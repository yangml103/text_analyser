This essay talks about the author’s desire to visit his ancestral home, Uganda, and his experiences during his time at Uganda. The start of the essay provides some background to the author’s connection to Africa and explains his rationale to wanting to visit the country. There are undertones of slavery and poverty throughout most of this essay.

Julian Hill’s first impressions of Uganda were very positive; he uses attractive language, such as “sweet” and “light” to describe the surroundings. This paints a warm and cozy picture of Uganda. After settling in for a week, he notes how assimilating into the community in Uganda will not be as easy as he first thought; even though there are no physical differences, his personality and demeanor are miles different to the native people in Uganda. This difference is then highlighted on a trip to meet some friends in an upscale part of Uganda. This was the first time he was called a “Muzungu” by the native people. 

After arriving at a bar with some American tourists, Julian mentions how he doesn’t feel at home with this group of people, and yet he is too westernized to truly integrate into the Ugandan culture. 

Finally, near the end of the essay, after helping a mutual friend tend to a plot of land, Julian starts to feel nostalgic about the experiences that he had during his brief time in Uganda. He contemplates on the effect that this trip has had on him, and wonders how the people of Uganda will perceive him after his departure.
